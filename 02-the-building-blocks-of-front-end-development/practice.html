        <p>There is a simple reason why Web Developer is such a hot job right now. Put simply, what Web Developers do
            is create how we experience â€¦ the web. If you proceed from the notion that every person who engages with
            the web would prefer a great experience, then you can say that everyone who engages with the web would
            prefer that a Web Developer have done a great job. Companies of course know this, so they hire Web
            Developers to ensure their sites provide great experiences. So, lots of websites and lots of users means
            lots of demand. LOTS of demand. ðŸ”¥</p>
